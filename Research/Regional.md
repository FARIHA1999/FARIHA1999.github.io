## <i>üìù Project: Exploring the Influence of Potential Factors of Urban Change in Bangladesh. </i> <br>

<p align="justify">  
<b>üîç Project Description</b> <br>
Bangladesh experiences rapid urbanization due to several factors such as population, economic work environment, elevation, proximity to city centre, roads, waterbodies. Hence the influence of this factor on urban change remains underexplored. To address this research gap, we have utilized several models to observe the affects of these factors on urban change. The models are Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XG Boost and Artificial Neural Network. Among all the models, Random Forest and XG Boost Performed comparatively well than the other two models. Several parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, ROC AUC are checked for the model‚Äôs evaluation. The results are presented division wise for Bangladesh to compare the regional variation of this factors also. However, the results indicate meaningful and comprehensive insights such as population, elevation and distance to waterbodies are the primary features for urban change. Exceptional results are also seen for a region called Barisal where built up change is dictated by distance to National Highway whereas other regions did not depict this type of results. From the earth observation and field verification, it had been observed that the region of Barishal urban change is hindered by a major river and it grows towards the national highways. However, these meaningful insights can help urban planners and policy makers to formulate plans to guide sustainable development.
