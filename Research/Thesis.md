## 📌 Major Findings

- The forestlands of Bhawal National Park are gradually encroached through establishing industries, settlements or expanding agricultural lands. 
- At present, 989.36 acres forestlands are illegally encroached by industries, agro based farms or private cottages. The total land valuation of the encroached lands is 197872 crore BDT. 
- The Forest Department have filed 985 eviction cases against the illegal encroachers. Only 326.36 acres (30%) forestlands are restored from the encroachers. 
- Before 2000, the issue of forest resource exploitation was extremely high as the forest resources were the only means of living for the poor people. 
- The management effectiveness of the protected area in only 30.13 percent. The present management system of the protected area is ineffective is conserving forest ecosystem.
- Bangladesh Forest Department has weak institutional capacity to directly enforce the laws against the forest crimes.
- The current management process is excluding the local people from decision-making process and management activities.
